# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) working in this repository. Keep it
accurate: a change to behavior that leaves this file describing the old one is
not done.

## Git workflow

Always start from a clean master:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

## Commands

```bash
npm test                                        # ESLint then all tests (Grunt)
npx mocha test/xslint.test.js --timeout 10000   # one test file
npx mocha test/xslint.test.js --grep sentence   # tests matching a pattern
npx grunt docs                                  # regenerate the docs/ site
npm run coverage                                # 100% branch gate (CI)
```

CI also runs, as separate jobs beyond `npm test`: `coverage`, `xcop`,
`copyrights` (SPDX header on every source file), `markdown-lint`, `yamllint`,
`typos`, `pdd`, and `fixtures`. A green local `npm test` does not mean CI is
green — run `npm run coverage` and the xcop suite too.

## Code style

ESLint (`eslint-config-google` + `@stylistic`, config in `eslint.config.mjs`,
run by the `lint` job) enforces: spaced operators, no single-letter names
(`id-length` >= 2), postfix `x++` only (prefix `++x` is banned), bare module
names in `require`/`import` (no `node:` prefix), no redundant return variable
(`const x = expr; return x` is banned — return the expression), no missing
argument (a call must fill every parameter the callee declares without a
default), and one `return` per function (a second exit is banned). The last
three are project-local rules in `eslint-local-rules.js`, unit-tested in
`test/eslint-local-rules.test.js`; the arity of the callee is read from its
declaration in the same file, or by loading the module a relative `require`
names.

A parameter a caller may leave out therefore says so in the signature, with a
default — `fix = undefined` on `defect` in `src/checks.js`. A JSDoc `[fix]`
alone does not count: the rule weighs `Function.length`, so an optional
parameter that the runtime signature calls required is a lint error at every
call that omits it.

A function likewise leaves through exactly one `return`, and the branching — not
the exit — decides what it carries: a lookup keyed on the deciding values
(`collapses` in `src/count-linter.js`), a ternary chain (`defectsOf` in
`src/corpus-linter.js`), or a sentinel a scan assigns before its loop ends
(`closes` in `src/expressions.js`). A `return` counts against the nearest
enclosing function, so a `map`/`every` callback carrying its own single `return`
is fine, and an arrow with an expression body has none at all.

**Every style or consistency convention must be machine-enforced.** When you fix
one, do not just fix the instances — in the same change add a check that fails on
the next violation (prefer a new `no-restricted-syntax` selector so no dependency
is added, else a CI job).

## Architecture

**xslint** is a CLI linter for XSL stylesheets. It runs in two stages.
**Validators** first establish that the input is valid; **linters** then run only
over what passed. Each validator *partitions* its input — it hands the valid part
to the next stage and reports the rest — so one broken file, or one malformed
expression, never hides the feedback on everything else.

```text
src/index.mjs             CLI entry (commander.js, ESM)
  src/xslint.js           discovery, config, run order, output; exports lint()
    validators — partition the input, report the bad part:
      src/xsl-validator.js       well-formed XML  -> builds the corpus
      src/xpath-validator.js     XPath syntax     -> keeps the valid expressions
    document linters — (corpus, suppressions) => defects:
      src/xpath-linter.js        declarative checks/xpath/*.yaml (per file)
      src/corpus-linter.js       declarative checks/corpus/*.yaml (cross file)
      src/*-linter.js            code-based checks/format/*.yaml (one construct each)
    expression linters — (expressions, suppressions) => defects:
      src/xpath-format-linter.js checks/format/redundant-whitespace.yaml
```

`src/xslint.js` exposes the whole staging as a pure function,
`lint(sources, {suppress, overrides}) => defects`: no file I/O, prints nothing,
never exits. The command-line `xslint(paths, options)` in the same module wraps
it — resolves config, reads the `.xsl` files, calls `lint`, applies `--fix`,
reports, and sets the exit code. The package `main` re-exports `lint` and
`fixed` so an embedder (the planned LSP server, #336) can lint a buffer without
shelling out; the bin stays `src/index.mjs`.

A check is one entry with **four kinds**, each a YAML file plus a motive plus a
test pack:

| Kind | YAML | Detection | Reported node |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `xpath` | `xpath` + `severity` + `message` | the XPath selects violations | selected node |
| `corpus` | `declaration`/`usage` (+ `reference`/`scoped`/`reachable`) | cross-file, declarative | the declaration |
| `validation` | `severity` + `message` | code (well-formedness, XPath syntax) | in code |
| `format` | `severity` + `message` | code (a `src/*-linter.js`) | in code |

No linter imports another. The declarative loaders (`xpath-linter`,
`corpus-linter`) and the token/DOM linters all share `src/xpath.js` (the
fontoxpath environment: prefixes, evaluators, `isValid`), `src/tokens.js` (the
positioned XPath lexer), and `src/helpers.js` (XML/YAML parsing, file
recursion). The staging is wired only in `src/xslint.js`: each linter is one
`{run, checks}` entry in `LINTERS`/`EXPRESSION_LINTERS`, and the `CHECKS` name
list that `--suppress` and config globs match is *derived* from those entries, so
a linter and its suppression names cannot drift apart.

No code-based linter selects attributes by name on its own. `src/attributes.js`
hands it every expression a stylesheet carries: an XPath or pattern attribute *of
an XSLT element*, whole, plus each expression an attribute value template encloses
in braces, offset by where it starts inside the value (#579). Each one says
whether it is a `pattern`, because the two are different languages and a rewrite
legal in one can be a syntax error in the other — `.` stands alone in an
expression but is a whole pattern rather than a step inside one, so `y|.` does
not parse and a bare `match="."` outranks the `self::node()` it replaced. A
fixer touching a step withholds inside a pattern; where the shorter form does
not exist there at all, the check does not report it either, the way it stays
quiet on a `parent::n` (#583). In an XSLT 3.0
stylesheet it also reads a **text value template** — the braces of a text node
whose nearest `expand-text`/`xsl:expand-text` is on — and a **shadow attribute**
(`_select` for `select`), the same expressions the modern idiom hides outside an
attribute (#606). An attribute a literal result element happens to call `test` or
`select` holds text destined for the result tree, so it is left alone — reading it
as XPath let `--fix` rewrite the output.

XPath binds prefix `xsl:` to the XSLT namespace; `xslint:` is reserved in
`src/xpath.js` for custom functions (none are registered now).

## Check formats

Per-file rule — `src/resources/checks/xpath/<name>.yaml`:

```yaml
xpath: <XPath selecting the violation nodes>
severity: warning|error
message: <one sentence, no trailing period>
```

Cross-file rule — `src/resources/checks/corpus/<name>.yaml`:

```yaml
declaration: <XPath selecting declared nodes that carry an @name>
usage: <XPath selecting the used names, across the whole corpus>
reference: "<optional substring template; {name} stands for the @name>"
scoped: <optional true>
reachable: <optional true>
severity: warning|error
message: <one sentence>
```

Without `reference`, a `declaration` is a defect when its `@name` matches no
`usage` value by exact identity. With `reference`, the match is by substring:
plain (defect when the string occurs nowhere, counting the declaration's own
body), `reachable: true` (follows the call graph — a defect when referenced yet
never reached from outside every declaration body), or `scoped: true` (counts
usage only within the declaration's subtree, or an importing file). Because usage
is followed across files, a symbol defined in a `_funcs.xsl` library and used
elsewhere is never flagged.

Validator and format checks — `checks/{validation,format}/<name>.yaml` — carry
only `severity` and `message`; their logic lives in code and the YAML just tunes
those two.

## Adding a rule

Names are kebab-case with no `template-match-` (or other noise) prefix. Every
rule needs a motive (`src/resources/motives/<kind>/<name>.md`) and at least one
test. `test/conformance.test.js` enforces the naming, the motive, and the
pack/test coverage for all four kinds — a rule that misnames itself, drops its
motive, or ships untested fails the build.

- **xpath rule**: add `checks/xpath/<name>.yaml` and
  `test/resources/xpath-packs/<name>.yaml`.
- **corpus rule**: add `checks/corpus/<name>.yaml` and
  `test/resources/corpus-packs/<name>.yaml`.
- **validation/format check**: the logic is code (a validator, or a
  `src/*-linter.js` wired into `LINTERS`); the YAML only tunes `severity` and
  `message`. A code-based format linter builds its defects through `src/checks.js`
  (`metaOf`, `suppressed`, `defect`) and reads its expressions from
  `src/attributes.js`'s `expressionsOf` (every XPath/pattern attribute of an XSLT
  element, plus every expression an attribute value template, a 3.0 text value
  template, or a shadow attribute carries, each flagged `pattern` or not) unless
  it has a documented reason to
  narrow — then it narrows through `selectorOf`, never a hand-written `//@name`,
  which an ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` selector bans.

Then run `npm test`, `npm run coverage`, and `npx grunt docs`.

### Mandatory rules

- **Version-dependence.** If a check's detection or fix is valid only for certain
  XSLT versions, the version test is part of the check. Read the version with
  `versionOf(node)` from `src/xsl-version.js` and test it with `since` against a
  floor such as its `MODERN` (code) — a version gate is a lower bound, not a list
  of spellings, so a construct 2.0 introduced is present in 4.0 too, and a hazard
  that begins where backwards compatible behaviour stops only deepens after
  (#619) — never
  `documentElement.getAttribute('version')`, which an ESLint rule bans because it
  misses a simplified stylesheet's `xsl:version`. Pass the **node under
  judgement**, not the document: `version` may sit on any XSLT element and
  `xsl:version` on any literal result element, each setting the version of its
  own subtree, so a document-wide answer misjudges a template raised or lowered
  against its root (#618). A code-based linter already holds that node from
  `expressionsOf`, so the gate belongs inside its per-expression loop, not above
  it. `versionOf` canonicalises the value too — `version` is an `xs:decimal`, so
  `2`, `2.0` and `2.00` are one version and answer `2.0` — and hands back
  anything it cannot place, which `malformed-version-in-stylesheet` reports rather
  than let a gate guess (#614). A declarative rule reads it
  structurally — `(/xsl:stylesheet | /xsl:transform)/@version` on an XSLT root,
  `@xsl:version` on any other root (a literal result element standing in as the
  stylesheet) — never a bare `/*/@version` (blind to a simplified root) or a
  presence fallback `(@version | @xsl:version)` (an SVG root's own `version`
  defeats it); `test/conformance.test.js` fails a selector testing `@version`
  without `@xsl:version`. Never emit a fix the declared version cannot run; emit
  the version-appropriate form instead (`count(x) > 0` -> `exists(x)` on 2.0+,
  `boolean(x)`/`x` on 1.0). A version-sensitive check with no version guard is a
  bug. Verify a version-based *exclusion* fires on the versions where its premise
  does not hold — an inert 2.0 attribute in a 1.0 sheet is still a defect.
- **Root-robustness.** A declarative rule that anchors on the stylesheet root must
  match both spellings: `(/xsl:stylesheet | /xsl:transform)[...]`, never
  `/xsl:stylesheet[...]` — they are exact synonyms in every version. Broaden a
  descendant root test too (`//(xsl:stylesheet | xsl:transform)`). A whole-rule
  root/version guard belongs at the root step (`/*[guard]//x`), not nested in a
  per-node predicate; nest it only when it gates a sub-clause. This is
  machine-enforced by `test/conformance.test.js`.
- **Selector hygiene.** A declarative selector must not test existence by
  counting — write `x` and `not(x)`, never `count(x) > 0` or `count(x) = 0`,
  the same anti-pattern `count-compared-to-zero` flags in a user's sheet.
  A comparison that asks a real cardinality (`count(x) >= 2`) is fine. This is
  machine-enforced by `test/conformance.test.js`.
- **Fix in the same change.** If a check is fixable, land the fix with the
  detection — never defer it. A declarative rule gets a `node => fix` builder in
  `src/fixers.js`; a code-based linter attaches the `fix` to its defect. Mark it
  `suggestion: true` unless the edit is deterministic and semantics-preserving.
  Cover it with a committed `test/resources/fix/<name>.{xsl,fixed.xsl}` pair
  (generate the `.fixed` by running `--fix`) plus rows in `test/fixer.test.js`'s
  `APPLIED`/`UNCHANGED`/`DROPPED` tables. A check whose only correct fix is
  structural stays report-only until the full-fidelity parser (#228); the missing
  fixer records that, and the motive stays silent about it (see **Motive
  quality**).
- **Motive quality.** A motive teaches the *construct*, not the tool. Lead with
  the concrete harm — why the flagged construct is wrong (correctness,
  portability, performance, or readability), not just that it is — then show an
  `Incorrect:`/`Correct:` pair of *valid* XSLT that resolves it, and where it
  helps, how to migrate by hand. It must not name a fix tier, mention
  `--fix`/`--fix-suggestions`/report-only, or describe scanner or parser
  internals: whether a check is fixable is data (the `src/fixers.js` wiring and
  the `suggestion` flag) that `README.md` lists and the docs site renders, never
  motive prose (#604). Keep the prose true to the selector: do not write "such as"
  for a closed list, call any `/`-prefixed match the "root template", or claim a
  hand-fix is loss-less when it shifts template priority or a value's type. Only
  motive existence is machine-checked today; turning the example pair into a
  `conformance.test.js` gate is pending the motive cleanup (#552).
- **Motive sync.** When you touch what a check flags — its severity, its version
  scope, the constructs it leaves alone — re-read its motive and update it. The
  motive is where the end user learns the construct's harm and hand-fix; a
  behavior change with an untouched motive is presumed a bug. A change to only the
  fix tier touches the wiring, `README.md`, and docs — not the motive.
- **Docs sync.** A behavior change must also update `README.md` (user-facing:
  usage, the `--fix`/suggestion lists), this file (architecture), and the docs
  site (`npx grunt docs`).

### Maturity (`mature: true`)

A check that has passed a full maturity audit carries `mature: true` in its
YAML. It is *frozen*: do not re-audit or churn it, and change its behavior only
by first removing the flag — a "perfect" check that changes must re-earn the
mark. A check is mature only when it meets every bar below; the last three are a
human attestation the flag records, the rest are visible in the tree:

- no false positive and no false negative (non-`xsl` prefixes, both roots, every
  version, the construct buried / 3+ times / beside a lookalike negative);
- the motive fully teaches it (see **Motive quality**);
- if fixable, the fix is implemented, correctly tiered, and tested — otherwise it
  is report-only *by nature* (no safe deterministic fix can exist); a fix merely
  deferred to a future capability (#228, #486, #461, #460) does not qualify. The
  report-only status shows in the wiring (no fixer), not the motive;
- the pack exercises the hard cases (see **Test packs**);
- version-dependence handled wherever the construct or fix needs it;
- the selector is optimal (no needless `//`, no `name()=`/`local-name()` where a
  namespace-bound node test works);
- it does not overlap another check.

`test/conformance.test.js` enforces the machine-checkable floor for a `mature`
check: its motive carries an `Incorrect:`/`Correct:` pair, and if it is fixable
(a `src/fixers.js` entry or a `test/resources/fix/<name>.xsl` fixture) that
fixture pair exists and `fixer.test.js` runs it. The opinionated checks tracked
in #499 are not marked mature until that issue is settled.

## Test packs

Each linter owns a `test/resources/<name>-packs/` directory, auto-discovered by
its harness — no registration. A pack is `pack` (the check name), `found`, and
`input` (or `inputs` for corpus/import packs, which reference each other as
`file<index>.xsl`). `found` carries `amount` and `positions` — `[line, col]`, or
`[fileIndex, line, col]` for cross-file packs, or `[line, col, other-check]` for
a co-firing check. A code-based linter's pack also carries `found.fixes` aligned
with `positions` (the expected `fix.replacement`, `null` for report-only), which
the harness asserts too.

- **Test the hard cases.** A pack must exercise more than one clean, top-level
  occurrence: the construct **buried** in a larger expression (a predicate, an
  `and`/`or` operand, a nested call), **three or more** occurrences in one
  expression (to catch a first-match bug), and the **negative neighbours** that
  look similar but must not fire. Positions pin every occurrence. A scan over a
  node *set* must exercise every node *kind* the selector yields — a `//text()`
  scan needs a CDATA section beside a plain text node, a `//*/@*` scan the
  literal-result versus XSLT-element split — because 100% branch coverage counts
  a branch one kind reaches as covered for all: a `nodeType`-blind crash sits
  green until a pack feeds it the other kind (#606).
- **Fixtures live in files.** Every test stylesheet is a committed `.xsl` under
  `test/resources/` (never inline in a `.test.js` — the `fixtures` CI job bans
  inline `<?xml`/`<xsl:`); YAML is only for the multi-field packs. Malformed
  fixtures go in `test/resources/malformed/` (excluded from the xcop workflow,
  since malformed XML cannot pass a formatting check).
- **xcop.** `test/xcop.test.js` re-serializes the inline XSL of every `*-packs`
  directory and runs [xcop](https://github.com/yegor256/xcop) over it; the CI
  `xcop` job runs it too. The `redundant-namespace-declarations` pack is listed in
  `UNFORMATTED` because its fixture must carry the unused namespace the check
  flags, which xcop would canonicalize away. The repo-wide sweep in the workflow
  excludes `test/resources/directives/wrapped*.xsl` for the same reason: they must
  keep the wrapped attribute value #611 is about, which xcop joins onto one line.
  Where the tool does not run, every fixture is registered and **pending**, never
  absent: a suite that asserts nothing must not read like one that passed, which
  is how 250 assertions went missing on a developer machine for months (#645).
  Whether it runs is settled by running it, not by looking it up in `PATH`. The
  CI job passes `--forbid-pending`, so in the one place the tool must be there,
  pending is a failure. A test registered behind a condition is banned by a
  `no-restricted-syntax` selector — skip it in its body with `this.skip()`.
- **Table-driven.** Where several `it` blocks differ only in data, express them as
  a data array plus one generator, not repeated blocks. When adding a test, add a
  row to the matching table (`test/fixer.test.js`, the pack harnesses,
  `test/config.test.js`, ...) before writing a new block.

## User configuration

- **Suppress**: `xslint --suppress=<rule-substring>` matches names across every
  validator and linter.
- **Config**: `.xslint.yml` (found by walking up, or `--config <path>`) can turn
  rules `off`, re-grade severity, `exclude:` file globs, and default
  `max-warnings`/`log-level`/`quiet`. Flags override the file overrides the
  defaults (`src/config.js`). Unknown keys and no-match patterns are reported.
- **Inline directives**: XML comments `xslint-disable-next-line`,
  `xslint-disable-line`, `xslint-disable-file`, each with optional space-separated
  rule names (`src/directives.js`); an unused directive is reported.
- **Fix tiers**: a defect is fixable when it carries
  `fix: {line, col, value, replacement, suggestion?}`. A code-based linter still
  reads an expression the XPath validator refused — it takes the whole corpus,
  not the validated part — so it still reports what it finds there, but `defect`
  withholds the fix, because rewriting text no processor parses is how
  `select="child::"` became `select=""` (#636). A declarative fix never passes
  through `defect` — `src/xpath-linter.js` attaches it from `src/fixers.js` — so
  it is gated there instead, against the same `expressionsOf` derivation: no fix
  is offered on an attribute whose expression the engine refuses, nor on the
  element carrying it, since a fixer names the attribute it wants inside itself
  where no gate can see it (#651). Withholding every fix on such an element is
  deliberate over-reach: an element holding an expression no processor parses is
  not worth tidying. A *safe* fix
  (deterministic, semantics-preserving) is applied by `--fix`; a
  `suggestion: true` fix (changes behavior, or is one of several corrections) is
  applied only by `--fix-suggestions`. `--fix-dry-run` writes nothing.
  `src/fixer.js` locates each fix by decode-walking the raw source, so a `>`
  written `&gt;` (#518) or a span shifted by an earlier entity (#525) still fixes,
  and an already-edited span is skipped rather than corrupted. Two fixes whose
  spans overlap cannot both be applied in one run (#571): the left-most wins,
  the wider of two that start together wins, and the loser is announced and left
  in the report for a later run — so a `.fixed.xsl` fixture may still hold a
  defect, and every one of them is parsed back by `test/fixer.test.js` to prove
  no run left broken XML behind.

| `src/checks.js` | Shared for code-based linters: `metaOf`, `suppressed`, `defect(check, meta, source, node, offset, expression, fix)` — walks the raw text so a wrapped or entity-shifted value reports where it truly stands (#611), and drops the `fix` when `expression` does not parse (#636) |
| `src/source.js` | Raw-text walking shared by `checks` and `fixer`: `offsetAt`, `placeAt`, `character`, `skip` |

| `src/xpath.js` | fontoxpath environment: prefixes, evaluators, `isValid` — which retries the expression respelled when the engine refuses a spelling the grammar allows: the `namespace::` axis, ExprWhitespace around an axis's `::` or in front of a node test's bracket (#615). A squeeze runs only between a step's own parts, and asks `src/tokens.js`'s `spelling` where a name begins, so the axis of `1-namespace::x` is respelled and the name of `a-namespace::x` is not. What the retry cannot claim is that it only ever widens what the engine accepts: its guards read characters rather than a parse (#641) |
